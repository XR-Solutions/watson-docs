# Introduction
Watson is a Mixed Reality app meant to help crime scene investigators in the Netherlands. The app will assist it's users with a growing set of forensic extensions, dedicated to a specific task. Users can interact with these extensions via their natural hand gestures, mobile companion app or even by talking to a copilot assistant. Information will be constantly available via the application and visible to the user through a heads up display. 

This application is developed as the final project for a minor in Mixed Reality by the University of Applied Sciences Leiden. The team behind the development is named XR-Solutions and consists out of students. We named ourselves XR-Solutions since we needed a GitHub organisation name and this one wasn't taken yet. The application is targeted to be used on the Microsoft HoloLens 2 specifically, besides that we do also support the Meta Quest 2 and 3.

## Who is this for?
This project can be used as a prototype for demonstration purposes. It can demonstrate possibilities for front line workers and especially crime scene investigators with Mixed Reality. The following possibly interested parties have been kept in mind during the project's lifespan.
- **Police (detectives/researchers/CSI)** who may be interested to 'play' around with this demo to eventually promote development in this area.
- **Students** who may want to expand and add new Forensic utilities on this project to learn more about Mixed Reality.
- **Curious Developers and Architects** who might want to view how certain features from our application have been developed to prevent doing that research themselves.

## Forensic aspect
This project is aimed at being a solution for Crime Scene Investigation. You can read more about the forensic extensions we created and the purpose behind each of these in Watson [here](./forensic-use.md). In summary we have tried to address the following CSI related subjects when developing this solution:
- On Site Reporting
- Chain of Custody
- Chain of Evidence
- Fluid Point of Origin Visualisation
- Bullet trajectory reconstruction
