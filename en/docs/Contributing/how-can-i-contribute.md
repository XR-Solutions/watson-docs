## Reporting Bugs
If you have noticed a bug in Watons, you can create a new ['Bug' issue in GitHub](https://github.com/XR-Solutions/watson-mr/issues) for the Watson MR project. Before you submit a bug, you can search if the bug already exists using [this list](https://github.com/XR-Solutions/watson-mr/labels/bug). You won't have to submit a new issue if your bug is already listed in that list.

When you submit a bug, please provide a clear and concrete description about the bug. What happened? And how can we try to repoduce the bug? This way we can effectively track and solve the bug.

## Take a ticket
If you see a ticket that has not yet been picked up, feel free to place your name next to it. Before you can start developing, it is helpfull to understand our [Repository Structure](./repository-structure.md) since it can be confusing at first sight. Make sure to follow the other pages in the Contributing docs, to effectively understand the way we work.
